Above all powers above all kings.
Above all nature and all created things.
Above all wisdom and all the ways of man.
You were here before the world began.
Above all kingdoms above all thrones.
Above all wonders the world has ever known.
Above all wealth and treasures of the earth.
Theres no way to measure what youre worth.
Crucified.
Laid behind a stone.
You lived to die.
Rejected and alone.
Like a rose.
Trampled on the ground.
You took the fall.
And thought of me.

You are my, my life.

Just how good You've been to me.
For all my friends who don't know You.
I pray that You would save them, too.
All for love a Father gave.
For only love could make a way.
All for love the heavens cried.
For love was crucified.
Oh how many times have I broken Your heart.
But still You forgive.
If only I ask.
And how many times have You heard me pray.
Draw near to me.
Everything I need is You.
My beginning, my forever.
Everything I need is You.
Let me sing all for love.
I will join the angel song.
Ever holy is the Lord.

All for a love a Saviour prayed.
Abba Father have Your way.
Though they know not what they do.
Let the Cross draw man to You.
Everything I need is You.
My beginning, my forever.
Everything I need is You.
Left my fear by the side of the road.
Hear You speak.
Won't let go.
Fall to my knees as I lift my hands to pray.
Got every reason to be here again.
Father's love that draws me in.
And all my eyes wanna see is a glimpse of You.
All I need is You.
All I need is You Lord.
Is you Lord.
One more day and it's not the same.
Your spirit calls my heart to sing.
Drawn to the voice of my Saviour once again.
Where would my soul be without Your Son.
Gave His life to save the earth.
Rest in the thought that You're watching over me.
All I need is You.
